## Commit-Reveal pattern in solidity

Here's an example implementation of a commit-reveal scheme in Solidity:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CommitReveal {
    bytes32 public hashedSecret;
    uint256 public revealBlockNumber;
    bool public isRevealed;

    function commit(bytes32 _hashedSecret, uint256 _revealBlockNumber) public {
        hashedSecret = _hashedSecret;
        revealBlockNumber = _revealBlockNumber;
        isRevealed = false;
    }

    function reveal(string memory _secret) public {
        require(block.number >= revealBlockNumber, "Reveal block number has not been reached yet");
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_secret)) == hashedSecret, "Invalid secret");

        isRevealed = true;
        // Do something with the revealed secret
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `commit` function is used to set the hashed secret and the block number at which the secret will be revealed. The `reveal` function is used to reveal the secret, which is checked against the hashed secret to ensure that it matches. If the secret is valid and the reveal block number has been reached, the `isRevealed` flag is set to true and the revealed secret can be used for further processing.

Note that this is a simplified example and does not include any security measures to prevent front-running or other attacks. In practice, you should carefully consider the security implications of any commit-reveal scheme and implement appropriate safeguards to protect against potential attacks.

### Examples

Sure, here are some examples of how you could use the `CommitReveal` contract:

Example 1: Voting
Suppose you want to implement a voting system where voters can submit their votes anonymously, but the results of the vote should only be revealed after a certain block number. You could use the `CommitReveal` contract to implement this as follows:

1. Each voter submits a hashed vote using the `commit` function, along with the block number at which the vote should be revealed.
2. After the reveal block number has been reached, each voter reveals their vote using the `reveal` function.
3. The revealed votes are tallied to determine the outcome of the vote.

Here's an example implementation of the `CommitReveal` contract for this use case:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Voting {
    struct Vote {
        bytes32 hashedVote;
        bool isRevealed;
    }

    mapping(address => Vote) public votes;
    uint256 public revealBlockNumber;
    uint256 public yesVotes;
    uint256 public noVotes;

    function commit(bytes32 _hashedVote, uint256 _revealBlockNumber) public {
        votes[msg.sender] = Vote(_hashedVote, false);
        revealBlockNumber = _revealBlockNumber;
    }

    function reveal(bool _vote) public {
        Vote storage vote = votes[msg.sender];
        require(!vote.isRevealed, "Vote has already been revealed");
        require(block.number >= revealBlockNumber, "Reveal block number has not been reached yet");
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_vote)) == vote.hashedVote, "Invalid vote");

        vote.isRevealed = true;
        if (_vote) {
            yesVotes++;
        } else {
            noVotes++;
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, each voter submits a hashed vote using the `commit` function, and the reveal block number is set to the same value for all voters. After the reveal block number has been reached, each voter reveals their vote using the `reveal` function, which increments the appropriate vote count based on the revealed vote.

Example 2: Lottery
Suppose you want to implement a lottery where participants can submit their numbers anonymously, but the winning numbers should only be revealed after a certain block number. You could use the `CommitReveal` contract to implement this as follows:

1. Each participant submits a hashed number using the `commit` function, along with the block number at which the winning numbers should be revealed.
2. After the reveal block number has been reached, the winning numbers are revealed using the `reveal` function.
3. The revealed numbers are compared to the winning numbers to determine the winners.

Here's an example implementation of the `CommitReveal` contract for this use case:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Lottery {
    struct Participant {
        bytes32 hashedNumber;
        bool isRevealed;
    }

    mapping(address => Participant) public participants;
    uint256 public revealBlockNumber;
    uint256[] public winningNumbers;

    function commit(bytes32 _hashedNumber, uint256 _revealBlockNumber) public {
        participants[msg.sender] = Participant(_hashedNumber, false);
        revealBlockNumber = _revealBlockNumber;
    }

    function reveal(uint256 _number) public {
        Participant storage participant = participants[msg.sender];
        require(!participant.isRevealed, "Number has already been revealed");
        require(block.number >= revealBlockNumber, "Reveal block number has not been reached yet");
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_number)) == participant.hashedNumber, "Invalid number");
    }
```

Commit-reveal is a common pattern used in smart contracts to ensure that certain information is kept secret until a specific point in time. Here's an example implementation of commit-reveal in Solidity:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CommitReveal {
    bytes32 public hashedSecret;
    address public owner;
    uint public revealDeadline;

    constructor(bytes32 _hashedSecret, uint _revealDeadline) {
        hashedSecret = _hashedSecret;
        owner = msg.sender;
        revealDeadline = _revealDeadline;
    }

    function commit(bytes32 _hash) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can commit");
        require(block.timestamp < revealDeadline, "Commit period has ended");
        hashedSecret = _hash;
    }

    function reveal(string memory _secret) public {
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_secret)) == hashedSecret, "Secret does not match hash");
        require(block.timestamp >= revealDeadline, "Reveal period has not started yet");
        // Do something with the revealed secret
    }
}
```

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract CommitReveal {
    bytes32 public hashedSecret;
    address public owner;
    uint public revealDeadline;

    constructor(bytes32 _hashedSecret, uint _revealDeadline) {
        hashedSecret = _hashedSecret;
        owner = msg.sender;
        revealDeadline = _revealDeadline;
    }

    function commit(bytes32 _hash) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the owner can commit");
        require(block.timestamp < revealDeadline, "Commit period has ended");
        hashedSecret = _hash;
    }

    function reveal(string memory _secret) public {
        require(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_secret)) == hashedSecret, "Secret does not match hash");
        require(block.timestamp >= revealDeadline, "Reveal period has not started yet");
        // Do something with the revealed secret
    }
}
```

In this example, the contract owner initializes the contract with a hashed secret and a reveal deadline. During the commit period, the owner can update the hashed secret. After the reveal deadline has passed, anyone can call the `reveal` function with the original secret to verify that it matches the hashed secret. If the secret matches, the contract can perform some action with the revealed secret.

Note that this is just a basic example and you may need to modify it to suit your specific use case.
